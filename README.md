**Want to translate to a new language?**  
1. Copy the /dev/ folder to the new language's i18n code (e.g German is de) folder.
2. Translate the core.json, common.json, and events.json files. **Do not translate** the JSON keys or text inside of `{{here}}` as these are references for the bot.
3. Submit a new Pull Request with the version it's translated for (should be current) and the i18n hypen the language name. (e.g `0.14.1 ru-Russian`).

**Translator badge** _(coming in a future version)_
